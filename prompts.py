# Base prompt template for market analysis
MARKET_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert financial analyst and trader specialized in futures markets. You will analyze market data to determine trading actions.

# Market Context
{context}

# Current Market Data
{market_data}

# Support and Resistance Levels
{support_resistance}

# Current Position
Current contracts: {current_position}
Maximum allowed contracts: {max_contracts}

Based on the data provided, analyze the market conditions and determine whether to:
1. ADD CONTRACTS (if bullish confidence is high)
2. REMOVE CONTRACTS (if bearish confidence is high)
3. WAIT (if confidence is low or direction is unclear)

Your confidence level should be on a scale of -100 to 100, where:
- Negative values (-100 to -1) indicate bearish confidence (the more negative, the more bearish)
- Positive values (1 to 100) indicate bullish confidence (the higher, the more bullish)
- Values close to 0 (-20 to 20) indicate uncertainty

Consider these key factors in your analysis:
- Current active positions and their performance
- Price relative to support/resistance levels
- Trend direction and strength
- Volatility (ATR)
- Directional entropy (market randomness)
- Volume profile and anomalies
- Price action patterns

Provide your reasoning and return your analysis in the following JSON format:
```json
{
    "market_summary": "Brief description of current market conditions",
    "confidence_level": <number between -100 and 100>,
    "direction": "Bullish/Bearish/Neutral",
    "action": "ADD_CONTRACTS/REMOVE_CONTRACTS/WAIT",
    "reasoning": "Detailed reasoning for your decision",
    "contracts_to_adjust": <number of contracts to add or remove>
}
```

Remember:
- Only recommend adding contracts when you have high confidence in a bullish move
- Only recommend removing contracts when you have high confidence in a bearish move
- Recommend waiting when confidence is low or uncertain
- The number of contracts to adjust should be proportional to your confidence level
- Consider the current position and maximum allowed contracts when making recommendations
"""

# Initial market context analysis template
INITIAL_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE = """
